# Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-Part-2

This introductory course explains how to perform basic sampling, hypothesis testing (one group means, two group means, categorical data, more than two group means), correlation and regression analysis. The contents for each week are as follows:

Week 1 - Sampling (This contains code to run basic descriptive analysis, draw histogram of distribution and to create a vector of a sample and to perform a simulation drawing a sample 1000 times).

Week 2 - Hypothesis tesing - One group means (Contains code to run a one-sampled t-test).

Week 3 - Hypothesis testing - Two group means (Contains code to run two-sampled t-tests (both paired and independent sampled tests).

Week 4 - Hypothesis testing - Categorical data (Contains code to run chi-squared tests (both goodness of fit and test of independence tests). 

Week 5 - Hypothesis testing - More than two group means (Code to create single and grouped boxplots, to compare means and sd across groups and to perform one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis). 

Week 6 - Correlation and regression analysis (Code to pull out a subset of people, create an object of variables to compare and to create a correlation matrix using Pearson and Spearman tests. Also, code to perform a simple regression using the 'lm' function and show a summary and confidence intervals).
